# Zulrah Visual Assistant
I wrote this application mostly as a way to work on some c# concepts and create a program that would be useful. 

This program uses voice commands to navigate through the Zulrah rotations instead of just showing all the rotations/phases at once.

I used this rotation picture from reddit to create the rotation files and the map assets (pulled the island path from it). I also used the color scheme that they used.
